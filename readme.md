# Project Overview

This project provides a set of Docker configurations for setting up a proxy and associated services using Docker
Compose. The project structure includes various Docker configurations, environment settings, and related files to
streamline the deployment process.

## File Descriptions

### `.gitignore`

This file specifies the files and directories that should be ignored by Git, such as environment configuration files,
build artifacts, and temporary files. This helps to ensure sensitive data and unnecessary files are not included in
version control.

### `readme.md`

The current documentation file you are reading. It provides an overview of the project structure and describes the
purpose of each component within the project.

### `docker-compose.yml`

The main Docker Compose configuration file that defines the services, networks, and volumes used in the project. It
includes configuration for the proxy service and any other dependent services.

### `.env`

This file contains environment variables that are used in the Docker Compose configuration. These variables include
sensitive information such as passwords, keys, and other configuration details that are passed to the containers at
runtime.

### `nginx/Dockerfile`

The Dockerfile for the Nginx service. It defines the base image, copies configuration files, and setups Nginx as a proxy
service.

### `nginx/nginx.conf`

The Nginx configuration file. It contains the Nginx server configuration, including proxy settings, server blocks, and
other directives to manage web traffic and routing to backend services.

### `normal/Dockerfile`

This Dockerfile is for a service named "normal" (specific service details would be defined in this file). It sets up the
environment and application for this particular service.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd docker-compose-proxy-fooocus
    ```

3. **Setup environment variables:**
    - Copy the `.env.example` to `.env` and configure it with your specific environment settings.

4. **Run Docker Compose:**
    ```sh
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

This will start up all the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Additional Information

- **Service Management:**
    - To stop the services:
      ```sh
      docker-compose down
      ```
    - To view running services:
      ```sh
      docker-compose ps
      ```

- **Logs:**
    - To view logs for a specific service:
      ```sh
      docker-compose logs <service-name>
      ```

By following these steps, you will have a running setup of proxy and related services defined in this project. For more
details on specific configurations, refer to the individual configuration files mentioned above.
